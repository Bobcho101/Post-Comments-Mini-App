# Post-comments-mini-app
This is an app that you can create posts and add comments to them

For this app i used page.js for routing and lit html for rendering and firebase for database and hosting.
I used sass too.
On this app u can upload an image from ur device and create a post with it. Every post has a comment section that you can add comments.

!The app is hosted globally so anyone can do anything. Here is the link: https://posts-with-comments-mini-app.web.app/
If you see a bad content on it, it's not my fault, but i would still try to filter some of it.
