# Post-comments-mini-app
This is an app that you can create posts and add comments to them

For this app i used page.js for routing and lit html for rendering and firebase for database and hosting.
I used sass too.
On this app u can upload an image from ur device and create a post with it. Every post has a comment section that you can add comments.

!The app is hosted globally so anyone can do anything. Here is the link: https://posts-with-comments-mini-app.web.app/
If you see a bad content on it, it's not my fault, but i would still try to filter some of it.
If you try to run the app locally type in the terminal: npm run dev
!!! Running it locally may have a problem if you get an error, type in the terminal: npm install firebase . If it doesnt get fixed when you run the app you can see what file it is not found. For example if it is lit html type in the terminal: npm install lit-html. For page js: npm install page.
