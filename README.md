<!-- This is an app that you can create posts and add comments to them

For this app i used page.js for routing and lit html for rendering and firebase for database and hosting. I used sass too. On this app u can upload an image from ur device and create a post with it. Every post has a comment section that you can add comments.

The app is hosted globally so anyone can do anything. Here is the link: https://posts-with-comments-mini-app.web.app/ If you see a bad content on it, it's not my fault, but i would still try to filter some of it. -->
